   1. how to compile vfu

     run `make' from vfu base directory

     this should compile everything

     to compile each part of vfu manually run these commands:

           git clone https://github.com/bbonev/yascreen.git
           make -C yascreen
           git clone https://github.com/cade-vs/vslib.git
           make -C vslib
           git clone https://github.com/cade-vs/vfu.git
           make -C vfu

     if something goes wrong, check these:

     -- if your `curses.h' file locations is not `/usr/include/ncurses'
        you have to change this in the Makefile.

     -- if vslib library is not in the `../vslib' directory you also
        have to change this in the Makefile.

     to get file sizes above 4GB shown properly you need to make this way:

            export CCDEF="-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64"
            make

       or

            make CCDEF="-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64"

   2. how to install vfu

      run `install' script from vfu base directory

      install script checks if all required files are available/built and
      then does this:

        cp vfu/vfu rx/rx_* /usr/local/bin
        cp vfu.1 /usr/local/man/man1
        cp vfu.conf /usr/local/etc

   3. how to install vfu manually

     -- you have to copy `vfu' in the `/usr/local/bin' or
        `/usr/bin' directory and set mode to 755 `rwxr-xr-x'
        the owner is not significant ( root is also possible ).

     -- there is preliminary man page ( vfu.1 ) which could be
        copied to /usr/man/man1.

     -- copy all `rx/rx_*' tools to /usr/local/bin
     -- install Net::FTP perl module if needed.
        (this is used for FTP support)

   4. requirements: VFU uses pcre perl-like regexp library.

      If you get error messages like these:

      > ~/src/vfu-4.09$ make
      > make -C vslib
      > make[1]: Entering directory `/home/cade/src/vfu-4.09/vslib'
      > true
      > g++  -I. -O2   -c vstrlib.cpp          -o .OBJ.libvslib.a/vstrlib.o
      > In file included from vstrlib.cpp:17:
      > vstrlib.h:28:18: error: pcre.h: No such file or directory
      > In file included from vstrlib.cpp:17:
      > vstrlib.h:178: error: ISO C++ forbids declaration of ‘pcre’ with no type
      > vstrlib.h:178: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘*’ token
      > vstrlib.h:179: error: ISO C++ forbids declaration of ‘pcre_extra’ with


      then you need pcre library. you should have package named something like:

        libpcre-dev

      in debian, for example, the correct package name is:

        libpcre3-dev

        apt-get install libpcre3-dev

      vfu also needs curses:

        apt-get install libncurses5-dev

      with all dev tools, in Debian/Devuan you need to:
      
        apt-get install make gcc g++ libpcre3-dev libncurses5-dev

      if you dont have this package or do not want to install it, you can
      try VFU (VSLIB) internal pcre library (i.e. pcre snapshot, used with
      permission, see vslib/README file):

        tar xzvf vfu-4.09.tar.gz
        cd vfu-4.09
        make -C vslib/pcre
        export CCDEF="-I../vslib/pcre"
        export LDDEF="-L../vslib/pcre"
        make

      this should help.
