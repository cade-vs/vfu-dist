  THANKS.TO
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are many people that I should thank... :)
  Few days ago ( about 1.Apr.2000(!) ) I was accused of not
  providing appropriate thanks/credits! Wow, it was a friend
  of mine :) so, from now on this file will keep
  track of all the people who did help the VFU project!

  BIG THANKS TO ALL OF THEM!

          is, probably, *not* complete! )
