      ! bugfix
      % note

   4.18: 31.Dec.2018

   + 1. Added estimate finish time reporting for copy/move operations.
   + 2. Added Autotools configure and compile (thanks to Andy Alt!)
   ! 3. Report available space instead of free space (root reserved).
   + 4. Added copy speed reporting.
   ! 5. Fixed directory size cache for larger than 999GB directories.

   4.17: 12.June.2018

   + 1. Directory size calculations menu (key "Z") has new options:
                * follow symlinks (WARNING: may cause loops!)
                * stay on the same device/filesystem
   + 2. Dynamic files list allocation: i.e. low memory consumption and
        unlimited files list count (up to the available memory)

   + 3. Added new rename tools:
                * prefix selected file names with current date
                * prefix selected file names with current date+time
                Tools (key "T") -> Rename tools (key "A")

   4.16: 05.May.2015

   % 1. Verified that VFU (and vstring/vslib) compiles clean with clang :)
   + 2. Added option to show file/dir sizes either in IEC or SI units.
        (cheers Larry :))


   4.15: 17.Jan.2014

   ! 1. Fixed bug with directory name completion which freezes VFU when case
        insensitive completion options is enabled.

   4.14: 04.Jan.2014

   % 0. Version 4.13 was skipped to match the year :)

   + 1. Added Alt+S to find next entry matching last incremental
        search (key "S").

   + 2. Added missing incremental search commands in the HELP :)
        (keys "S" and "Alt+S").

   + 3. VFU (and VF before it) was designed to keep directories on top of
        the file list. There is flag for disabling this inside the code,
        but it was never visible. Now this long lost option is exported
        to the options menu. :)

   + 4. Added "Smart" Home/End keys navigation. When this option is enabled
        HOME and END keys will toggle between top and bottom of the files list
        and firs/last directory or file.
        Example:
                 * first HOME will go to the beginning of the file list
                 * next HOME will go to the first file (not dir) in the list
                 * first END will go to the bottom of the list
                 * next END will go to the last directory in the list
        Actually "next HOME" will be assumed when current position is already
        top of the list and also "next END" will be triggered when position
        is at the bottom entry in the list.

   4.12: 21.Dec.2011

   ! 1. Fixed problem with strcpy/memmove inside vstring lib.
        (thanks to Boyan Anastasov)

   % 2. VString support library was revised to avoid possible buffer overlaps
        on different platforms and libc implementations.

   + 3. Added BACKSPACE as alternative dismissal key for all menu boxes along
        with ESCAPE key.
        (requested for use on Nokia N900 hardware keyboard)

   - 4. Removed restriction for the color of directories. Now can be selected
        in the config file as the rest of the file/directory types.

   + 5. Added "Case insensitive file/dir names matching" option. Will discard
        case on directory completion and filenames incremental search 's' key.

   4.11: 19.Aug.2010 pre-release

   + 1. Directory history is larger on larger terminals.
        (limit raised from 14 to 128 entries)

   ! 2. Fixed bug causing wrong recognition of files time inside ZIP arcives.

   % 3. Included PCRE upgraded.

   4.10: 16.Dec.2009

   - 1. removed 'bookmark1' to 'bookmark9' config file options.
        now only (repeated) 'bookmark' can be used.

   ! 2. fixed ALT+1 to ALT+9 bookmarks hotkeys.

   ! 3. fixed several problems with rx_* tools and some archives filenames.


   4.09: 14 Apr 2009

   ! 1. fixed 64-bit offset formats under 32-bit platform (SEE).
    thanks to svilen <sdobrev@sistechnology.com>

   ! 2. Initially this release was timestamped 05 Aug 2006, but it is
        not correct. Actually released now :) 14 Apr 2009

   + 3. Added option for default target directory to be current working dir.

   % 4. Moved to git :) cheers!

   % 5. Cygwin package for vfu is now available! Thanks to Jari Aalto!
        http://www.cygwin.com/
        http://cygwin.com/packages/
        http://cygwin.com/packages/vfu/

   % 6. Applied patches several from Debian.

   4.08: 26 Oct 2005

   + 1. %g and %G shell line options added:

        %g  -- same as %f but for each selected filename
        %G  -- same as %F but for each selected filename
               %g and %G produce list of filenames. each filename
               is surrounded by '
               if filename contains ' then " is used.
               example: 'file1' "file2's" 'file"3"' ...

   + 2. %! shell line option added:

        %!  -- request shell line to be shown before execution (debug mode)

   4.07: 28.Aug.2005

   + 1. Tools/Rename_Tools/Replace_SymLink_w._Original tool added.
        You can select symlink (file only) then call this tool. It
        will remove the symlink and rename original file to the
        place of the symlink:

          ls sym: sym -> org
          rm sym
          mv org sym

   + 2. Tools/Go_To_Symlink_Target tool added.
        It can change directory to symlink target's one and go to
        target name. It is useful if you want to inspect symlink
        target.

   + 3. Tools/Go_Back_To_Last_Target tool added.
        This can bring you back to the last entry you were before
        using Tools/Go_To_Symlink_Target tool. This can be used
        multiple times and will lead to toggling between symlink
        and its target.

   4.06:  06.Jun.2005

   ! 1. Sizes above 4GB are now correctly shown/calculated.
        (needs 'make CCDEF=-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64')

   4.05:  05.Jun.2005

   ! 1. update of dir size cache is optimized for multiple dirs.
   + 2. GlobalSelect/Extended/SelectToBegin/End of list added.

   4.02:  06.May.2003

     ! 1. Compilation problem fixed.

   4.01:  28.Apr.2003

          arrays and tries (hashes) with referenced data (shared).

     ! 1. Various small fixes (logic and less memory alloc/dealloc).
     ! 2. SeeViewer is now fixed for screens larger than 80 columns.
     ! 3. Fixed Lynx-style navigation.
     ! 4. New faster directory size cache!

          expressions (i.e. in regexp searches, see viewer, etc.).
     ! 7. Now SeeViewer highlights found strings in the current visible page.
     ! 8. Hex mode of SeeViewer was rewritten. Now it supports several 8-byte
          columns for different width terminals.
   + 9. Clipboard is now functional (key P).
   -10. bookmark1 .. bookmark9 options in config file are now replaced with
        single one: `bookmark' which can be used multiple times

   4.00:  27.Nov.2002

     % 0. Hope this is the new next stage in the VFU development :)

     ! 1. Fixed rxvt emulation BS handling.
          (actually found why is that... to fix this issue
           add `Rxvt*backspacekey: ^H' line to your .Xdefaults)

   3.04:  24.May.2002

     % 0. This version should be named over `04' as result of
          large number of changes (most internal ones)...
          Still I'll wait next release to be able receive any
          bug reports before major version change...
          (there is about 1.5 years since 3.03:))

     + 1. Added FastSizeCache option -- turns off directory
          resolving for directory size cache which means that
          the cache will act faster but you won't get sizes for
          symlinked dirs.

     + 2. Added `Randomize' function to file list arrange menu.

     ! 3. Rename tools now work on filename only, not on the full
          pathname (usual bug in recursive scanning -- Ctrl+R)

     ! 4. Fixed loops on incremental searches in the files list and
          directory tree.

     + 5. Actual files size is now reported before copy/move.

     + 6. Size cache is now auto-cleaned on dir size recalculation.

          skipped quietly).

     ! 8. Temporary files used for view filters are now removed.

     ! 9. Now all temporary files and directories are set owner
          read/write/traverse permission only.

     !16. Now extension colors loaded from DIR_COLORS are added to
          those from vfu.conf (not overwritten)

     !17. Internal: changed all PSZCluster+StrSplitter to VArray+VTrie

     !18. Fixed configuration file problems (missing archives etc.)

     !19. SIGWINCH finally works, i.e. VFU redraws on terminal resize
          (please report any problems regarding this one!)

   3.03:  31.Dec.2000

     ! 1. Documentation fixed to address directory bookmarks in the
          vfu.conf correctly. ( bookmark#=path )

     ! 2. Added option for VFU to handle Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+\ as
          it is expected (suspend,interrupt,quit).
      To use it you have to export UNICON_NO_RAW environment var
      with any value. ( for bash: `export UNICON_NO_RAW=1' )

     ! 3. User menu is fixed.

     + 4. Change directory completion menu is now sorted.

     + 5. Sequential rename function added (Tools/Rename menu)

     + 6. Now directory sizes cache is removed from the directory
          tree, so you can have directory sizes saved even if you
          don't have directory tree built.

   3.02:  01.Aug.2000

     ! 1. Several DJGPP (DOS/Win9x) portability fixups.
     ! 2. Fixed problem with input line for long directory names.
     ! 3. Fixed directory tree sizes calculation.
     + 4. Added inode size cache for directories that are new to

     ! 8. Alt+B browse/view current file w/o filters.
     + 9. Now install script set sample config file into
          /usr/local/etc (to get personal config file you
          have to copy /usr/local/etc/vfu.conf to ~/.vfu/vfu.conf
          or ~/$RC_PREFIX/vfu/vfu.conf if you have set $RC_PREFIX )

     !10. Ctrl+L refresh/redraw page problem is now fixed.
     !11. Several little fixups.

   3.00:  20.May.2000

     % 0. Hello again! :)
          The VFU development was suspended nearly an year
          ago. Now it is resumed and a lot of changes took place!
          First of all -- VFU was completely rewritten/revised(!),
          so many (internal?) features were added, some removed,
          other changed. Below I will list some key features in
          this version, but probably I'll forget some things or
          else...

     % 1. There are no big changes in the user interface and feel.

     - 2. Now reading/extracting archives is removed from inside
          VFU to external (perl) utilities. This will help adding
          new archives and debugging existing ones.

     - 3. Now archives' structure is followed as the local file
          system, i.e. you will browse directory by directory
          but not the whole archive content as before. Perhaps
          option for recursive (whole content) browsing will be
          added in the future.

     + 4. Now you can cancel copy/move procedures at stage you
          want even during single file copy process!
          (It was not possible in older versions)

     ! 5. The rare problem of showing total percentages over 100%
          during copy/move is finally (and hopefully:)) fixed.

     + 6. Now files in archive can be masked and files mask can
          be changed inside archive.

     ! 7. Some access/terminal emulation problems are fixed.
          ( i.e. some `difficult' key functions are accessible
          and from menus etc. )

   1.51: 31.May.1999

     + 1. Debian `.deb' packages are now supported as archives!
     ! 2. All paths containing `dir/..' are reduced.
     ! 3. Now arcive files are recognized by longer extensions
          like `.tar.gz'. Result is proper handling of `.tar.gz'
          and `.tar.bz2' archives.

     + 4. Added SEE Viewer filters. Now you can view gzipped files
          and or add filters for viewing man pages etc.

     + 5. Added ready `panelizers' command to the RescanMenu
          ( key Ctrl+R ) Can be used as menu alternative to
          external panelize option.

     ! 6. SEE screen draws improved and `< >' bug is fixed.
     ! 7. GetDirName function now allows dirs only.
     + 8. Added UserMenu ( key `U' ). User external commands
          can be attached not to key but to this menu.

     + 9. Bash/Unix-style filename completion added!
     -10. Bash/Unix-style completion is now default one!
     +11. Now entries in the filelist can be moved ( see
          ArrangeMenu/MoveEntry )

     !12. Now VFU keeps current file position after change
          of sort order.

     !13. Better preserve/copy mode/protection when copy/move
          directory subtrees. ( from RO media for example )

     !14. Fixed erase of own directories without `write'
          permission/mode.

     !15. More examples and comments added to the sampe
          configuration file: vfu.conf.

   1.50: 27.Mar.1999

     % 0. This is primarily bugfix release, supposed to form
          final stable release with all planned features. :)

     ! 1. CR_LF problem in Seed is now solved.
     ! 2. Total/Free space calculation problem is fixed.
     ! 3. GlobalSelect/Grep file search problem (finally!) fixed.
     ! 4. EditEntry/OwnerGroup now accepts `user' format
          instead of `user.' (i.e. no trailing dot required)
     ! 5. Fixed problem with Seed and new files (create).
     ! 6. `/etc/DIR_COLORS' loads properly now, even if
          vfu.conf doesn't exist.
     ! 7. Items (files/dirs) colors are changed properly now after
          mode/protection change.
     + 8. Now VFU shows and current hostname.
     + 9. AutoIndent option added to Seed ( key: Ctrl+T )
     !10. Fixed problem with free space check before Copy/Move.
     -11. VFU will not resort files after Ctrl+Z on directory and
          sort order is `size'.
     +12. Preliminary man page added. ( vfu.1 )

   1.46: 19.Mar.1999

     + 1. Support for /etc/DIR_COLORS (for file-type colorization)
          See Option/UseEtcDirColors.

     + 2. Small internal Text editor added! (can be used as
          emergency editor if no other available)
          See Option/UseInternalEditor.

     + 3. Added Lynx-like arrow keys navigation:
          UpArrow/DownArrow    -- scroll list
          LeftArrow/RightArrow -- enter/exit/cdup
          See Options/AltArrowsNavigate.

     + 4. Separate histories to all input lines. Use
          PageUp/PageDown to recall.

     + 5. Now SymLink references can be edited in-place.
          See EditEntry(key TAB)/EditSymLinkReference(key L).

     + 6. File Find results can be panelized now.

     ! 7. The usual bugfixes ( not important really ).

     - 8. Changed location for personal config and other related files,
          now default place is `$HOME/.vfu'. Changed VFU config file
          name from `vfurc' to `vfu.conf'.
          Please read CONFIG file!

     + 9. Now the internal Viewer and Editor (See/Seed) have separate
          options files. The `see(d).options' location is
          `$HOME/$RC_PREFIX/.see(d)/see(d).options'.

   1.45: 03.Mar.1999

      + 1. `%i' and `%n' macros added. (See above for details)

      ! 2. Now VFU won't expand masks if you enter external scan/panelize
           command in the file mask field.

      ! 3. Now VFU will remember internal file viewer options during the
           same session.

      + 4. GlobalSelect/SelectSame/Type(TP) function added.

      + 5. HexEditor added! See the help in the internal file viewer
           ( press `I' in the HEX mode of the internal file viewer )

      ! 6. Fixed pattern searching function ( it didn't work before with
           patterns that contains char codes >128 sometimes )

      + 7. FTP support! See above for details.

      ! 8. Few bugfixes as usual...

   1.44: 14.Feb.1999

      + 1. Auto mounting on change directory added.
           ( see Options/AutoMount )
           If you chdir to a directory which contains only
           one file named `automount', then VFU will try to
           mount this directory automatically. After mounting
           `automount' file won't be visible. You can create
           file with `echo > automount' command.

      + 2. Unmount feature added to the `JumpToMountpoint'
           menu ( key `j' ).

      + 3. PreserveSelection option added. If this option is
           enabled VFU will preserve selected files after
           rescanning files list. ( see Options menu )

      + 4. Added Ctrl+Z key to the Directory Tree View for
           update the current (under cursor) directory size.

      ! 5. Fixed tilde `~' expansion -- now standalone
           `~' or `~username' are expanded properly.

      + 6. RecursiveRescanning can be canceled with ESC now.
      ! 7. Options(Toggles) separators bug fixed.
      ! 8. User External Utilities are enabled in InArchive mode
           as it should be. (considered bug)
      ! 9. Dotfiles `.filename' colorization fixed.

   1.43: 12.Feb.1999

      ! 1. Now VFU supports properly screens >80x25
           (fixed bug with 80-columns filename view)

      - 2. ENTER has priority now for entering into archives
           than executing user external program.

      + 3. Added option for handling .TGZ equally to .tgz, i.e.
           case insensitive archive extension detection.

      + 4. RenameTools added to the tools menu (key `T')

      + 5. Added one more location for global vfurc file: `/etc/'
           it is searched first. Can be changed through VFU_RCPATH0
           define.

      ! 6. Now $HOME/.vfurc is primary if exists ( before global
           vfurc's as it should be ) considered as bug :)

      - 7. ENTER key behavior changed:
           If not defined for user external utility, ENTER works
           as browse/view. It also assumed equal to '+' or '=' for
           archives ( i.e. cannot be redefined for archives,
           there's INSERT and Fx alternatives, however if someone
           needs ENTER for this I probably can change it ).

      + 8. MenuBorders option added. It can improve menu visibility
           on mono/colorless terminals.

   1.42: 03.Feb.1999

      + 1. External scanning ( panelize ).
           Just enter `command |' in the files masks input line
           to use it ( i.e. instead of "*.txt" enter
           "find / -name '*.txt'" ).

      ! 2. The problem with files/dirs' sizes >2GB is now fixed!

   1.41: 04.Dec.1998

      + 1. Added Options/FileCopyPreserveOwner/Group option.
           If enabled VFU will try to preserve files owner and
           group id's on copy/move if possible.

      - 2. Now `dir1' is equal to `presetdir1' etc. in the vfurc
           meaning.

      + 3. BZip2 archives now supported
           NOTE!: you have to get tar-1.2+ patched to support -I
           option which is BZip2 support. required extensions for
           such files are `bz2' or `tbz' (second one is mine:))

      + 4. `Time/Touch' entry added to the `EditEntry' function
            (TAB key), i.e. change file(s)'s modify and access
            times.

      + 5. Now VFU expands ~ with username (~cade/boo) but only if
           target directory is started with ~.

      + 6. Added `Show Real Free Space' toggle to the options.

      + 7. Recursive rescanning added ( Ctrl+R key menu ). Now
           you can operate over all files from a tree branch!

      + 8. A lot of cleanup work done.

   0.40 ... 1.41: xx.xxx.xx

      % 0. FAQ: Why is this? You have skipped these version numbers?
           Well the answer is something like:

           The versions 0.xx were meant to be kind of alpha/beta
           versions and are not supposed to be released to the public
           in the beginning ( didn't happen :)). Well, the
           versions after 0.40 are considered `stable' and `official'
           now, so I've added `1' to them... ( there's 1 year since
           BETA status was removed :))

   0.40: 31.Sep.1998

      + 1. Internal Text/Hex file viewer/browser added!
           See Options/InternalViewer. Hit `H' to get help inside
           viewer. (The viewer is available and as standalone
           utility called `See')

      + 2. Extended filename completion: now you can enter for
           example: `/level/next/one[mM]o?r*' and hit TAB to complete!

      + 3. Everywhere you enter directory path you can use:
             Ctrl+X -- expand to real path
             Ctrl+A -- delete back one dir level
             Ctrl+S -- show list with matching directories (kind of
                       visual tab-completion)

      + 4. Key-names for `user external commands' are shorter:
             KEY_F1 is now F1
             KEY_SH_F1 is now #F1 (Shift+F1)
             KEY_ALT_F1 is now @F1 (not available under Linux)
             KEY_CTRL_F1 is now ^F1 (not available under Linux)
             KEY_IC is now either INSERT, INS or IC
             KEY_ENTER is now ENTER

      + 5. `Tools/Classify move' tool added.

      + 6. `GlobalSelect/Extended/Find;Scan;Hex;Regexp;String' added!

      + 7. Extended FileFind menu added (Ctrl+N).
           FileFind with Find/Scan/Hex/Regexp string added.

      - 8. New Options/Toggles system (Now it is more flexible for
           adding/displaying new toggles -- really sorry if you
           liked old one :( )

      + 9. Now file types: `** [] <> () etc...' can be used instead
           of file extensions in the user external command:
           ux=EXECUTE,INS,.**.,%w

      +10. Now VFU has option to zap/erase READ-ONLY files. (see options)

      +11. Many command line switches added! (run `VFU -h' for help)

      +12. Find/Scan/Hex/Regexp string search added to the internal
           file viewer/browser!

      +13. User External Commands are now available and in InArchive
           mode!

      +14. FileMasks expanding added to `files mask' filter and file find
          tool.
          ( for more details see `FAQ/What are the mask expansion rules' )

      +15. GlobalSelect/Different function added.

   0.30: 25.Sep.1998

      + 1. Archives support! Now VFU supports the following archives:
           zip, tar, tgz, uc2, arj, lha, rar
           (for more details see `Usage notes' section)

      + 2. Now VFU follows sym-links.

   0.22: 30.Aug.1998

      % 1. Support VFUSHELL environment variable -- it is used to
           override SHELL variable (to use login shell for example)

      + 2. Added `GlobalSelect/All+Dirs' function.
      + 3. Preserve timestamps on copy.
      + 4. Report target file status on overwrite (copy/move/etc.).
      + 5. `Insert/Overstrike' modes in all input lines.
      + 6. Added `History' to most of the input lines.
           (try PageUp/PageDown keys in input lines)

      + 7. Now incremental search can work and with patterns.
          (for example if you enter `>*.cpp' VFU will track on all
           *.cpp files -- please note the leading `>'!)

      - 8. Now options(keywords) in the vfurc file are
           NOT case sensitive.
           (for example you can type `BrOwSeR=less %f')

      + 9. `TrimTree' option added to vfurc.
            example: TrimTree=/mnt/cdrom/ /proc/ /tmp/
            You can use these separators:
              UNIX: [,:] space and tab.
               DOS: [,;] space and tab.
            DOS users note: TrimTree doesn't support
            driveletters! I mean if you want to trim `c:/tmp/'
            you should add `TrimTree=/tmp/' but this will cut also
            `d:/tmp/' -- This is NOT bug but WAD.

      +10. Now you can use file type identifiers for filename
           colorization (also `dotfiles' for `.name' dotfiles).
           For example:

           cGREEN=.cpp.h.**.().
           cRED=.[].txt.dotfiles.
           cBLUE=.<>.

           all .cpp, .h, executable files and pipes are GREEN
           all .txt, dotfiles and directories are RED
           all links to directories are BLUE


   0.21: 02.Aug.1998

      % 0. Oops... I forgot -- If someone want to know why I'm
           trying to support DOS platform: the reason is that I
           use DJGPP+RHIDE for development environment -- it is
           more comfortable than gcc+joe :) Well I know that
           there is RHIDE for Linux but I haven't tried it yet...

      + 1. New file attributes/mode set/get engine.
           Now VFU supports different attrib's under
           different OS-es transparently:
           Linux/UNIX: `drwxrwxrwx'
           DOS:        `DV----RHSA'

      + 2. `VFFilenames' style added for DOS *only*! This means
           all dirs' names are upper case and all file names
           are lower case (but this is only for the screen!)

      + 3. Added IncrementalSearch to the file list and the
           directory tree ( key Ctrl+S, and TAB to advance ).

      + 4. Copy/Move/Erase now work on directories (w. entire
           substructures)!

      + 5. `CDTree' option added. This is similar to bash's
           CDPATH env.variable but the needed path is searched
           in the directory tree. For example: if you are in the
           HOME directory and try to ChDir to `rc.d' -- VFU will
           check for HOME/rc.d, which not exist, then will try to
           find such dir in the DirTree (if the tree is not built,
           VFU will try to just to load it from disk), most probably
           `/etc/rc.d/' will be found and VFU will ChDir to it.

      + 6. New shell-macros: %e, %E, %s, %R, %c, %C
      + 7. Added `JumptToMountpoint' function ( key `J' )
      + 6. Added `MakeDirectory' to `Tools' menu ( key `T' )

   0.20:  4.Jul.1998

      % 0. Changes are too much to list (will try to describe
           most important ones). The main change is that

           -- VFU goes portable --

           Currently it supports Linux, Solaris, DOS(!).
           (I mean that I have compiled it for these OS-es myself)
           Win32 version is on the way...
           Note that DOS version supports long filenames (LFN's)!
           To use this support you have to `set LFN=Y' in the
           environment.

      + 1. `Options/Toggles' screen added (key `O' or Alt+O)
           Options menu (key `o') still exists but is empty for now.
      + 2. Now you can switch off parts of file information
           (i.e. mode/attr, owner, group, time, size...
            see Options/Toggles).
      + 3. DirectoryTree added (key Ctrl+D) incl. hot key
           search `a'-`z'.
      + 4. `DynamicScroll' option added -- it switch all lists
           scrolling between `page-by-page' or `line-by-line'.

   0.15: 15.Mar.1998

      + 1. SymLinks -- `l' key.
      ! 2. RmDir/Links bug is now fixed.
      ! 3. Other minor bugfixes.

      % 4. Since VF/U passed large enough test period without
           any major problems or any kind of data loss etc.,
           `BETA' status has been removed.

   0.13BETA: 17.Oct.1997

        There's not such version really. :) trust me... :)

   0.12BETA: 06.Oct.1997

      + 1. GlobalSelect/+/-/= -- select/deselect by mask.
      + 2. UserExternals commands added (see vfurc description).
      + 3. Now vfu will search for environment variables 'EDITOR'
           and 'PAGER' (or 'BROWSER') to set editor and pager/browser.
           (if not given in vfurc file)
      + 4. TAB/chown now accepts 'username.groupname' instead
           of 'uid.gid'.
      + 5. GlobalSelect/Same..name/ext/size/owner/group added.
      + 6. Inline editing caps added.
      + 7. File masks added.
      + 8. VFU or VF screen/view styles added.

   0.11BETA: 20.Aug.1997

   0.10BETA: 07.Aug.1997

      ! 1. bug with following directory links when calculating
           directory(ies) size is now removed.
      ! 2. now vfu shows file type correctly. (links,dir.links)
      + 3. link realpaths are now shown: "linkname -> realpath".
      + 4. "Tools/r-realpath" added, shows real path for a link.
      + 5. "Options" added -- key "o"/"O".
      ! 6. problem with unknown uid/gid is now fixed.
      + 7. "ChDirHistory" added -- key "D".

   0.08BETA: 30.Mar.1997

      ! 1. get dir name logic fixed.
           ( don't worry if you don't know what that means,
