    1. What is 'TY' (formerly 'TP') field on the third line?

       This stands for "type" and means:
       
       [] -- directory
       <> -- link to directory
       -> -- link
       ** -- executable
       ++ -- character device
       ## -- socket
       () -- FIFO (pipe)
       == -- block device
       -- -- regular file
       
       it is used for quick visual hint about file entry type.


    2. Does VFU follows directory links when calculating directory(ies) size?

       No. :)
       
       Well, not by default. There is an option to do so in the dir sizes 
       menu (key Z) but it is not permanent option and will reset when 
       VFU quits/starts.


    3. I cannot see entire filename?

       Try '0' -- it will show only filenames or
       try '1'..'6' to toggle different info entries.
       Also available from the options menu (key O).


    4. What files are considered `executables' (i.e. marked `**')

       File is marked `**' if any of `x' modes are set (regardless
       owner, group, etc.) This means that if file has mode of
       -rwxr--r-- and you are not owner the file will be still marked
       as `**' but you won't be able to execute it.


    5. Do I need to set `HOME' environment variable under DOS, and where
       it is supposed to point?

       Yes. In general, the HOME directory is used to keep all
       configuration and status files. Well, if you don't set it, VFU
       will set HOME directory into TEMP ( c:/tmp/ under DOS )
       But keep in mind that VFU is UNIX file manager in nature so
       it can use HOME under DOS for something else in the future,
       so it is recommended to set it. ( just to be safe :) )


    7. How can I use `JumpToMountpoint' function under DOS?

       NOTE: since 2023 VFU drops support for DOS/DJGPP/GO32.
       However, you may still use pre-5.0 versions.

       The information for this function comes from the `/etc/mtab'
       file. This file show currently mounted file systems.
       Under DOS platform the only way is to simulate this file, which
       is quite simple -- You have just to create `_vfu.mtb' file in the
       HOME (see FAQ 6 above) directory.
       Content of this file is: (this is example)

       ---cut---
       -        c:/
       -        d:/
       -        j:/
       ---cut---

       Please note the leading `-', it must be here. However you can
       add whatever you want ( I mean paths ), but normally you just
       should add roots of all drives.


    8. I've just created `some/newdir' in the current directory. VFU
       reported no error, but I cannot see it.

       Well, you just have to hit 'r' to reload directory content.
       I know this may be confusing at first, but currently it just works 
       this way by design.


    9. How can I exit to new directory from vfu (UNIX)

       On exit VFU always try to create file named `/tmp/vfu.exit.USERNAME`
       where `USERNAME' is current user's user name :) for example my
       filename will be named `/tmp/vfu.exit.cade'. To make use of this file
       you should define alias or function (bash) for it like this example:

       function vfu()
         {
         /usr/local/bin/vfu $*;
         cd `cat /tmp/vfu.exit.$USER`;
         rm -f /tmp/vfu.exit.$USER;
         }

       This is bash function that does the trick. If someone need this
       for other shell or with an alias then please contact me.

       After this you can use `q' to exit VFU and cd to the VFU's current
       working directory.

       You can change this filename by exporting new name in this way:

       export VFU_EXIT="/tmp/my.exit.file.$$"

       And VFU will use it instead of default one.

       NOTE: DOS version should work without this -- the `q'uit function
             will work out of the box.


   10. What is `Name###' sort order? And why should I RTFM? :)

       This mode forces sort order as follows:

       file names are: `vs011.txt', `vs04.txt', `vs030.txt'
       sort order is : `Name'
       the result is : `vs011.txt', `vs030.txt', `vs04.txt'

       file names are: `vs011.txt', `vs04.txt', `vs030.txt'
       sort order is : `Name###'
       the result is : `vs04.txt', `vs011.txt', `vs030.txt'

       ...in a few words: if the file name (until first dot if exist)
       ends with number, VFU will sort them in regard to the numeric
       values found at the ends of the filenames.

       tech note: RegExp used is "^(.*)([0123456789]+)(\\.(.*))?$" 

       NOTE: This mode drops all after the first dot!
       NOTE: This mode resets on exit!


   11. How the tilde expansion is done in VFU?

       It works only in standard input line for getting directory
       name which is used for: chdir, copy, move... it won't work
       in vfu.conf or anywhere else.


   12. What is the mask expansion and how it works?

       If no `*' or `?' found in the mask then:
           1. add `*' at the end
           2. if mask starts with `.' then add `*' to the front
       else
           1. leave it `as is'
           
       If you don't like the expansion, you can switch it off in the
       options menu (key O): 
       
         Options(Toggles)/FilesMaskExpand and FileFindMaskExpand options.


   13. Where mask expansion applies and can I turn it off?

       Wherever you need to enter mask! (file list masking, global
       select, file find, etc...)
       You can turn it off form the options menu (key O).


   14. Can I browse/view more than one file at the same time?

       NOTE: as of early 2023 this is temporarily disabled.

       Yes! You have just to select needed files and press 'B'
       (browse). Then use `1'..`0' to switch between files/slots.
       The limit is 10 files.


   15. What `Show Real Free Space' option means?

       Some operating systems keep users from filling the
       entire filesystems. So there are two `free spaces' the one is the
       `real free space' ( i.e. physical one ) and `user free space'
       which is the free space available to the user.
       By default VFU shows the free space available to the user.
       If you want to use the real free space count -- turn this on.


   16. How can I use the FTP support?

     NOTE! as of Nov.2002 VFU doesn't use `ftparc' anymore!
     Instead rx_ftp uses Net::FTP perl module.

       All you need to use FTP support is:

       a. install Net::FTP if you haven't done this already.
       
          on any linux you can install it with cpan:
          
            $ cpan Net::FTP
          
          on Debian Linux it is inside `perl-modules' package:
          
            $ apt-get install perl-modules

       b. create needed FTP file "archives":

       example:

          create plain text file:

          cade-at-jane.ftp

          ---cut---
          jane.tetida.org
          cade
          password
          ---cut---

          This file has to contain three lines: 

              host
              username
              password

       c. Then from inside VFU press `+' or `ENTER' to enter FTP site
          just as it is plain archive file.

          More details could be found in the README file with rx_*.
          (rx directory under VFU main distribution directory)


   17. I cannot enter archive/ftp! What's wrong?

       Since version 3.00 VFU uses external utilities to handle
       archives/ftp. These utilities are named rx_ext, where
       `ext' is archive type extensions. However VFU calls
       `rx_auto' which decides which specific `rx_*' to call.
       So the solution is: make sure rx_* utilities are
       in the path. Then test the result of `rx_auto l archive',
       it should return something like:

       ---cut---
       NAME: some/name.ext
       SIZE: 1024
       MODE: -rwx---rwx

       NAME: other/name.misc
       SIZE: 1110
       MODE: ----------

       ...
       ---cut---

   18. What is the interface to those rx_* tools?

       rx_* tools should provide the following commands:

       rx_ftp v archive directory
   view contents of `directory' of archive `archive'

       rx_ftp V archive directory
   view contents of `directory' of archive `archive'
   recursively (i.e. all filenames are with full path,
   `directory' is ignored )


       rx_ftp x archive files...
   extract files from archive

       rx_ftp x archive @listfile
   extract files from archive (but get the list from
   file named `listfile')

       examples:

         rx_tar v vfu-3.01.tar.gz /vfu-3.01/vslib/
         rx_tar V vfu-3.01.tar.gz
         rx_tar x vfu-3.01.tar.gz /vfu-3.01/ftparc/README

       The expected format that has to be returned for commands
       `v' and `V' is:

       ---cut---
       NAME:filename
       SIZE:12345678
       MODE:-rwxr-xr--
       TIME:YYYYMMDDHHMMSS

       NAME:filename
       SIZE:12345678
       MODE:-rwxr-xr--
       TIME:YYYYMMDDHHMMSS

       ...
       ---cut---

       Currently only NAME and SIZE are supported! The order for
       fields is random. Each entry is separated with empty line.
       `filename' contains only filename for `v' command and full
       path for `V' command.


       examples:

       `v' command:

       ---cut---
       NAME:README
       SIZE:605
       MODE:-rw-r--r--
       TIME:200005231124

       NAME:vfumenu.h
       SIZE:614
       MODE:-rw-r--r--
       TIME:200005191052

       NAME:vfusetup.h
       SIZE:1327
       MODE:-rw-r--r--
       TIME:200008010017

       NAME:makefile
       SIZE:3772
       MODE:-rw-r--r--
       TIME:200005191058

       ---cut---

       `V' command:
       ---cut---
       NAME:vfu-3.02/vfu.1
       SIZE:16773
       MODE:-rw-r--r--
       TIME:200008010118

       NAME:vfu-3.02/build.netbsd
       SIZE:832
       MODE:-rwxr-xr-x
       TIME:200006171605

       NAME:vfu-3.02/README.DOS
       SIZE:430
       MODE:-rw-r--r--
       TIME:199902161511

       NAME:vfu-3.02/TODO
       SIZE:685
       MODE:-rw-r--r--
       TIME:200006172251

       NAME:vfu-3.02/ftparc/ftparc.cpp
       SIZE:7521
       MODE:-rw-r--r--
       TIME:200004161224

       ---cut---


   19. What does Tools/RenameTools/SimplifyName do?

       First replaces all `special' symbols as `'&\"/ etc with _
       then it compresses all repeating _'s and finally it replaces
       `_-_' with `-'.

       NOTE: suggestions are welcome.

   20. How can I purge directory sizes cache?

       The sizes cache is flushed on directory tree rebuild.

   21. Why I cannot execute image viewer (or any prog) on a file
       inside archive? It reports `file not found' error?

       The problem is when you want to spawn image viewer with `&'
       on background. At this point VFU has taken control back and
       temporary file/dir is removed. There is no slick solution to
       this and only workaround is to remove `&' from your command.

   22. How to make VFU to handle Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+C?

       You have to export UNICON_NO_RAW environment variable:

       export UNICON_NO_RAW=1
       vfu
       ...

   23. Is it possible to see file sizes above 4GB properly?

       NOTE: since version 5.0 (early 2023) this is not needed.

       Yes, you have to compile this way:

          export CCDEF="-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64"
          make

       or

          make CCDEF="-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64"

   24. When I change directory (key "D"), VFU prints this line:
       "use keys: TAB, PageUp, PageDown, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+A".
       What are those keys used for?

       -- TAB completes currently typed directory path
          (only rightmost level)

       -- PageUp brings history of all previously entered directories
          (including for copy/move/chdir)

       -- PageDown brings history of all previously visited directories
          (chdir history)

       -- Ctrl+X expands currently typed directory path to the true path
          (removes symlinks)

       -- Ctrl+A removes rightmost directory level from the typed path

   25. What are those "*"s and "!"s appended to file time?
   
       "*" means that time is in the last 23 hours.
       "!" means that time is in the future.

   26. When file is a symlink, what information VFU shows about it?
   
       Traditionally VFU shows all the information of the symlink's target.
       Since 5.10, VFU has option to show symlink own details, which include
       mode (only 'l' flag is meaningful), ownership and size (the length of
       the filename which symlink points to). The options is accessible vi
       "Options" menu (key 'O'), then toggle "Show symlink stats" (key 'l').
       VFU will not reread current file list to update symlink info after 
       options changed.

   99. I don't/do like feature X, can I turn it OFF/ON?

       VFU has a lot of options to alternate behaviour.
       Check in the options menu (key O) if there is applicable toggle.
       If not, contact me to discuss it :)
