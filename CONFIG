  VFU CONFIGURATION, OPTIONS AND CACHE FILES LOCATIONS
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  By default VFU searches these locations for `vfu.conf' config file:
 
  1. personal vfu.conf ( explained below )
  2. /etc/
  3. /usr/local/etc/
  4. /usr/local/
 
  The personal vfu.conf is located in `$HOME/.vfu/' directory and it is
  created if not exist. The same directory is used for keeping options
  and cache files ( directory tree, history, options, etc. )
 
  Well, More than 1/3 of all files in my home directory are various
  configuration ( dotfiles -> `.name' ) files for many applications
  ( and directories as well ). I think that if all these files/dirs
  are moved to `$HOME/etc/' or `$HOME/.conf/' or similar directory,
  the home directory will look a lot more clean. I know that dotfiles
  are considered `hidden' but I'd like to see all files w/o such
  restrictions. I also know that keeping configs in `$HOME/.name'
  files is usual since the beginning, but it doesn't help.
 
  Simple solution to this problem is to check for exported
  environment variable called `RC_PREFIX' and if found to check
  for config files in `$HOME/$RC_PREFIX/.name' ( where `.name'
  is the config file or dir ). Is $RC_PREFIX is not defined all
  configs will go as usual in the `$HOME/.name'.
 
  VFU works in this way and I have got always $RC_PREFIX defined
  to `etc' ( i.e. vfu.conf goes in `$HOME/etc/.vfu/' ).

  NOTE: The text above is probably more than 20 years old :) I don't know
  for wide-spread idea to keep all dot files separate but lately $HOME/.config
  started to gather more and more configuration files, so I think that is a
  safe choice :)
